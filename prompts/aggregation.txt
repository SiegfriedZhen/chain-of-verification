You are given a set of credibility assessments for multiple pieces of evidence, each evaluated independently. Your task is to:

1. Review each evidence assessment to determine if it is VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED, or DEBUNKED
2. If ANY evidence is VERIFIED, the final result should be VERIFIED
3. If NONE of the evidence is VERIFIED but at least one is UNVERIFIED, the final result should be UNVERIFIED
4. If ALL evidence is DEBUNKED, the final result should be DEBUNKED
