Your task is to create verification question templates that can be used to detect misinformation in OSINT evidence by comparing it with our dataset.

Focus on creating templates that will guide Python code to query and analyze our dataset for verification.

Example OSINT Information: According to social media posts, Politician X has received donations from Company Y in 2022.
Example Verification Question Template: 
- Can data analysis confirm that [entity] is associated with [another entity] as claimed?
- Does our dataset contain evidence supporting the claim that [specific event] occurred on [date]?

Create templates for Python code that will query and analyze the dataset.

OSINT Information: {osint_information}
Collected Evidence: {collected_evidence}

Final Verification Question Template:
