You are evaluating the credibility of a single piece of evidence based on data verification results. Your task is to determine if this evidence is VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED, or DEBUNKED.

Original Evidence:
{collected_evidence}

Verification Results:
{verification_answers}

Based on the verification results, carefully assess the evidence and classify it as:

1. VERIFIED: The evidence is strongly supported by data verification
2. UNVERIFIED: Data verification could not conclusively confirm or debunk the evidence
3. DEBUNKED: Data verification contradicts the evidence or reveals it to be false

Provide your assessment in the following JSON format:
{{
  "status": "VERIFIED|UNVERIFIED|DEBUNKED",
  "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your reasoning",
  "key_findings": [
    "Key finding 1",
    "Key finding 2"
  ]
}}
