Your task is to create specific verification questions based on the OSINT evidence items. Create EXACTLY ONE verification question for EACH evidence item.

Example OSINT Information: According to social media posts, John Smith was in Paris on June 15, 2023 attending a tech conference.
Example Collected Evidence: 
- Location data from Twitter shows John Smith was in Paris on June 15, 2023
- Instagram posts with Paris geotags from John Smith dated June 15, 2023
- Conference attendance list includes John Smith's name

Important: Generate EXACTLY one verification question per evidence item. Each question should be directly testable with Python code against a dataset.

Collected Evidence: {collected_evidence}

Final Verification Questions output should be in JSON format:

{{
  "verification_questions": [
    "Can data analysis confirm that John Smith was in Paris on June 15, 2023 based on Twitter location data?",
    "Can data analysis confirm that John Smith's Instagram posts had Paris geotags on June 15, 2023?",
    "Can data analysis confirm that John Smith's name appears on the tech conference attendance list?"
