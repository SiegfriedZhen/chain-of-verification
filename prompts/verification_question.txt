Your task is to create a series of verification questions based on the evidence provided. These questions will be used to verify the factual accuracy of the evidence.

For each statement or claim in the evidence, create specific, targeted questions that can be verified through data analysis. Focus on breaking down complex claims into simpler, verifiable components.

Example Evidence:
"According to data from 2020, Company XYZ increased their revenue by 25% while reducing employee headcount by 10%."

Example Verification Questions:
1. Did Company XYZ's revenue increase by 25% in 2020?
2. Did Company XYZ reduce employee headcount by 10% in 2020?

Guidelines:
1. Questions should be precise and focused on a single verifiable fact
2. Each question should be directly answerable through data analysis
3. Break complex claims into multiple simpler verification questions
4. Focus on quantitative claims that can be verified with data 
5. Questions should be independent from each other
6. Create at most {max_questions} verification questions (this is a strict limit)

Evidence to verify:
{collected_evidence}

Output a JSON object with the following format:
{{
  "verification_questions": [
    "Question 1",
    "Question 2",
    "Question 3"
  ]
}}

Remember: The maximum number of questions allowed is {max_questions}. Do not exceed this limit.
