Data Path: data/yt_tsai_secret.xlsx

Your goal is to execute Python code to analyze the data and answer all questions in a comprehensive, coherent way.

Important Guidelines:
1. Treat all questions as related to the same evidence
2. Share analysis results across questions when relevant
3. Be systematic and thorough in your approach
4. Provide clear conclusions for each question
5. Consider how the answers collectively reflect on the evidence's credibility

Use the analyze_data tool to run your Python code. The ReAct agent will help you execute this task step by step.
